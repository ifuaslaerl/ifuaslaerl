# Hi there, I'm Luís Rafael Sena!

### Electronic & Computer Engineering Student @ UFRJ

I am a software engineer and researcher passionate about **Algorithms**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **High-Performance Computing**.

I currently work as an Undergraduate Researcher at **Signal Processing Lab (LPS)**, developing acoustic detection systems, and I am a competitive programmer for the **Competições de Algoritmos e Programação UFRJ**.

**Current Focus**: I am currently grinding to qualify for the **ICPC World Finals**!
